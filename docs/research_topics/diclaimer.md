# My personal manifest as a Data Scientist

## I believe that lies in statistic have severe social impact. E.g.: brainwashing nations to tolerate wars or justify violence against minorities by abusing stats in mass media.

## I also believe that with current level of technological progress we can improve data quality to make stats lie less.

## I see my mission in Data Science not only to analyze the "given" data and pass it on to ML / AI ("downstream"), but to use results of my analysis to define requirements to the data quality, demand the improved data from the "upstream" and help them identify existing or implement new tools of getting the data to the required quality state. But without turning myself into DataOps / Data engineer. And for this I need to use python math libraries and visualization tools to prove value of this all and achievability to the businesses.

E.g.: sometimes it will only take upstream service developers to add some fields in their APIs with no dramatic refactoring.
